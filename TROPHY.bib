  abstract = {Novel approaches toward understanding the evolution of disease can lead to the discovery of biomarkers that will enable better management of disease progression and improve prognostic evaluation. Raman spectroscopy is a promising investigative and diagnostic tool that can assist in uncovering the molecular basis of disease and provide objective, quantifiable molecular information for diagnosis and treatment evaluation. This technique probes molecular vibrations/rotations associated with chemical bonds in a sample to obtain information on molecular structure, composition, and intermolecular interactions. Raman scattering occurs when light interacts with a molecular vibration/rotation and a change in polarizability takes place during molecular motion. This results in light being scattered at an optical frequency shifted (up or down) from the incident light. By monitoring the intensity profile of the inelastically scattered light as a function of frequency, the unique spectroscopic fingerprint of a tissue sample is obtained. Since each sample has a unique composition, the spectroscopic profile arising from Raman-active functional groups of nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates allows for the evaluation, characterization, and discrimination of tissue type. This review provides an overview of the theory of Raman spectroscopy, instrumentation used for measurement, and variation of Raman spectroscopic techniques for clinical applications in cancer, including detection of brain, ovarian, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers and circulating tumor cells.},

  abstract = {Histological staining is the gold standard for tissue examination in clinical pathology and life-science research, which visualizes the tissue and cellular structures using chromatic dyes or fluorescence labels to aid the microscopic assessment of tissue. However, the current histological staining workflow requires tedious sample preparation steps, specialized laboratory infrastructure, and trained histotechnologists, making it expensive, time-consuming, and not accessible in resource-limited settings. Deep learning techniques created new opportunities to revolutionize staining methods by digitally generating histological stains using trained neural networks, providing rapid, cost-effective, and accurate alternatives to standard chemical staining methods. These techniques, broadly referred to as virtual staining, were extensively explored by multiple research groups and demonstrated to be successful in generating various types of histological stains from label-free microscopic images of unstained samples; similar approaches were also used for transforming images of an already stained tissue sample into another type of stain, performing virtual stain-to-stain transformations. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the recent research advances in deep learning-enabled virtual histological staining techniques. The basic concepts and the typical workflow of virtual staining are introduced, followed by a discussion of representative works and their technical innovations. We also share our perspectives on the future of this emerging field, aiming to inspire readers from diverse scientific fields to further expand the scope of deep learning-enabled virtual histological staining techniques and their applications.},

  abstract = {Current methods for cancer detection rely on tissue biopsy, chemical labeling/staining, and examination of the tissue by a pathologist. Though these methods continue to remain the gold standard, they are non-quantitative and susceptible to human error. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic imaging has shown potential as a quantitative alternative to traditional histology. However, identification of histological components requires reliable classification based on molecular spectra, which are susceptible to artifacts introduced by noise and scattering. Several tissue types, particularly in heterogeneous tissue regions, tend to confound traditional classification methods. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the current state-of-the-art in image classification, providing the ability to learn spatial characteristics of images. In this paper, we demonstrate that CNNs with architectures designed to process both spectral and spatial information can significantly improve classifier performance over per-pixel spectral classification. We report classification results after applying CNNs to data from tissue microarrays (TMAs) to identify six major cellular and acellular constituents of tissue, namely adipocytes, blood, collagen, epithelium, necrosis, and myofibroblasts. Experimental results show that the use of spatial information in addition to the spectral information brings significant improvements in the classifier performance and allows classification of cellular subtypes, such as adipocytes, that exhibit minimal chemical information but have distinct spatial characteristics. This work demonstrates the application and efficiency of deep learning algorithms in improving the diagnostic techniques in clinical and research activities related to cancer.},

  abstract = {This article presents global cancer statistics by world region for the year 2022 based on updated estimates from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). There were close to 20 million new cases of cancer in the year 2022 (including nonmelanoma skin cancers [NMSCs]) alongside 9.7 million deaths from cancer (including NMSC). The estimates suggest that approximately one in five men or women develop cancer in a lifetime, whereas around one in nine men and one in 12 women die from it. Lung cancer was the most frequently diagnosed cancer in 2022, responsible for almost 2.5 million new cases, or one in eight cancers worldwide (12.4\% of all cancers globally), followed by cancers of the female breast (11.6\%), colorectum (9.6\%), prostate (7.3\%), and stomach (4.9\%). Lung cancer was also the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18.7\%), followed by colorectal (9.3\%), liver (7.8\%), female breast (6.9\%), and stomach (6.8\%) cancers. Breast cancer and lung cancer were the most frequent cancers in women and men, respectively (both cases and deaths). Incidence rates (including NMSC) varied from four-fold to five-fold across world regions, from over 500 in Australia/New Zealand (507.9 per 100,000) to under 100 in Western Africa (97.1 per 100,000) among men, and from over 400 in Australia/New Zealand (410.5 per 100,000) to close to 100 in South-Central Asia (103.3 per 100,000) among women. The authors examine the geographic variability across 20 world regions for the 10 leading cancer types, discussing recent trends, the underlying determinants, and the prospects for global cancer prevention and control. With demographics-based predictions indicating that the number of new cases of cancer will reach 35 million by 2050, investments in prevention, including the targeting of key risk factors for cancer (including smoking, overweight and obesity, and infection), could avert millions of future cancer diagnoses and save many lives worldwide, bringing huge economic as well as societal dividends to countries over the forthcoming decades.},

  abstract = {Histopathological analysis of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has seen a surge in the utilization of deep learning methods, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, CNNs often fall short in capturing the intricate spatial dependencies inherent in WSIs. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) present a promising alternative, adept at directly modeling pairwise interactions and effectively discerning the topological tissue and cellular structures within WSIs. Recognizing the pressing need for deep learning techniques that harness the topological structure of WSIs, the application of GNNs in histopathology has experienced rapid growth. In this comprehensive review, we survey GNNs in histopathology, discuss their applications, and exploring emerging trends that pave the way for future advancements in the field. We begin by elucidating the fundamentals of GNNs and their potential applications in histopathology. Leveraging quantitative literature analysis, we identify four emerging trends: Hierarchical GNNs, Adaptive Graph Structure Learning, Multimodal GNNs, and Higher-order GNNs. Through an in-depth exploration of these trends, we offer insights into the evolving landscape of GNNs in histopathological analysis. Based on our findings, we propose future directions to propel the field forward. Our analysis serves to guide researchers and practitioners towards innovative approaches and methodologies, fostering advancements in histopathological analysis through the lens of graph neural networks.},

We discuss how SHG can be used to obtain more structural information on the assembly of collagen in tissues than is possible by other microscopy techniques. We first provide an overview of the state of the art and the physical background of SHG microscopy, and then describe the optical modifications that need to be made to a laser-scanning microscope to enable the measurements. Crucial aspects for biomedical applications are the capabilities and limitations of the different experimental configurations. We estimate that the setup and calibration of the SHG instrument from its component parts will require 2--4 weeks, depending on the level of the user{$\prime$}s experience.},

  abstract = {The large and still increasing popularity of deep learning clashes with a major limit of neural network architectures, that consists in their lack of capability in providing human-understandable motivations of their decisions. In situations in which the machine is expected to support the decision of human experts, providing a comprehensible explanation is a feature of crucial importance. The language used to communicate the explanations must be formal enough to be implementable in a machine and friendly enough to be understandable by a wide audience. In this paper, we propose a general approach to Explainable Artificial Intelligence in the case of neural architectures, showing how a mindful design of the networks leads to a family of interpretable deep learning models called Logic Explained Networks (LENs). LENs only require their inputs to be human-understandable predicates, and they provide explanations in terms of simple First-Order Logic (FOL) formulas involving such predicates. LENs are general enough to cover a large number of scenarios. Amongst them, we consider the case in which LENs are directly used as special classifiers with the capability of being explainable, or when they act as additional networks with the role of creating the conditions for making a black-box classifier explainable by FOL formulas. Despite supervised learning problems are mostly emphasized, we also show that LENs can learn and provide explanations in unsupervised learning settings. Experimental results on several datasets and tasks show that LENs may yield better classifications than established white-box models, such as decision trees and Bayesian rule lists, while providing more compact and meaningful explanations.},

Gold-standard assessing using immunohistochemistry adds subjectivity due to interlaboratory and interobserver variations. In order to increase the diagnosis confidence, other techniques need to be examined, where the FTIR spectroscopy imaging allied with machine learning techniques may provide additional and quantitative information regarding the molecular composition. However, the impact of co-added scans acquisition parameter into machine learning classifications still needs better evaluation. In this study, FTIR images of Luminal B and HER2 subtypes were acquired varying the scan number and preprocessing techniques. It was demonstrated a spectral quality improvement when the scan number was increased, decreasing the standard deviation and outliers. Six machine learning models were used to classify the subtypes: Linear Discriminant Analysis, Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting. Best mean accuracy of 0.995 was achieved by Extreme Gradient Boosting model. It was found that all models achieved similar high accuracies with groups b256\_064 (256 background and 064 scans), b256\_128 and b128\_128. Besides assessing the performance of different models, the b256\_064 was established as the optimal group due to the minimum acquisition time. Therefore, this work indicates b256\_064 for breast cancer subtype classification and also as a basis for other studies using machine learning for cancer evaluation.},

The stain has been unchanged for many years because it works well with a variety of fixatives and displays a broad range of cytoplasmic, nuclear, and extracellular matrix features. Hematoxylin has a deep blue-purple color and stains nucleic acids by a complex, incompletely understood reaction. Eosin is pink and stains proteins nonspecifically. In a typical tissue, nuclei are stained blue, whereas the cytoplasm and extracellular matrix have varying degrees of pink staining. Well-fixed cells show considerable intranuclear detail. Nuclei show varying cell-type- and cancer-type-specific patterns of condensation of heterochromatin (hematoxylin staining) that are diagnostically very important. Nucleoli stain with eosin. If abundant polyribosomes are present, the cytoplasm will have a distinct blue cast. The Golgi zone can be tentatively identified by the absence of staining in a region next to the nucleus. Thus, the stain discloses abundant structural information, with specific functional implications. A limitation of hematoxylin staining is that it is incompatible with immunofluorescence. It is useful, however, to stain one serial paraffin section from a tissue in which immunofluorescence will be performed. Hematoxylin, generally without eosin, is useful as a counterstain for many immunohistochemical or hybridization procedures that use colorimetric substrates (such as alkaline phosphatase or peroxidase). This protocol describes H\&E staining of tissue and cell sections.},

Methods: In this review, we explored a number of scientific databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Google Scholar for research studies on Raman spectroscopy for diagnosing cancer. We reported key outcomes of research studies conducted involving Raman spectroscopy for diagnosis of cancer and highlighting the potential of novel Raman spectroscopy for diagnosing cancer in our review. Results: Based on the available evidence it can be strongly concluded that Raman spectroscopy provide significant information for diagnosing cancer. Numerous comprehensive studies involving living cells in vitro, in-vivo animal models and ex-vivo human tissues pre-clinical Raman experiments are conducted on biological specimens for almost every type of cancer for diagnosing cancer demonstrating the potential for clinical use of Raman spectroscopy. Furthermore, the in-vivo Raman handheld probes are developed and experimentally used for real time detection of human breast and brain tumors with significant sensitivity and specificity. However, it will be important and challenging to explore relevant Raman biomarkers for other types of cancer as well, to distinguish cancer.  Conclusion:  Raman spectroscopy is an effective method and valuable tool in the field of cancer diagnostics. The Raman spectroscopy deserves a place for future in clinics for rapid cancer diagnostics.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks are currently among the most commonly used classifiers. Despite easily achieving very good performance, one of the best selling points of these models is their modular design - one can conveniently adapt their architecture to specific needs, change connectivity patterns, attach specialised layers, experiment with a large amount of activation functions, normalisation schemes and many others. While one can find impressively wide spread of various configurations of almost every aspect of the deep nets, one element is, in authors' opinion, underrepresented - while solving classification problems, vast majority of papers and applications simply use log loss. In this paper we try to investigate how particular choices of loss functions affect deep models and their learning dynamics, as well as resulting classifiers robustness to various effects. We perform experiments on classical datasets, as well as provide some additional, theoretical insights into the problem. In particular we show that L1 and L2 losses are, quite surprisingly, justified classification objectives for deep nets, by providing probabilistic interpretation in terms of expected misclassification. We also introduce two losses which are not typically used as deep nets objectives and show that they are viable alternatives to the existing ones.},

  abstract = {Accurate intraoperative diagnosis is essential for providing safe and effective care during brain tumor surgery. Our standard-of-care diagnostic methods are time, resource, and labor intensive, which restricts access to optimal surgical treatments. To address these limitations, we propose an alternative workflow that combines stimulated Raman histology (SRH), a rapid optical imaging method, with deep learning-based automated interpretation of SRH images for intraoperative brain tumor diagnosis and real-time surgical decision support. Here, we present OpenSRH, the first public dataset of clinical SRH images from 300+ brain tumors patients and 1300+ unique whole slide optical images. OpenSRH contains data from the most common brain tumors diagnoses, full pathologic annotations, whole slide tumor segmentations, raw and processed optical imaging data for end-to-end model development and validation. We provide a framework for patch-based whole slide SRH classification and inference using weak (i.e. patient-level) diagnostic labels. Finally, we benchmark two computer vision tasks: multiclass histologic brain tumor classification and patch-based contrastive representation learning. We hope OpenSRH will facilitate the clinical translation of rapid optical imaging and real-time ML-based surgical decision support in order to improve the access, safety, and efficacy of cancer surgery in the era of precision medicine.

However, convolution filters only extract local features and neglect long-range self-similarity information, which is the vital prior information commonly existing in image data. To this end, we put forward a new backbone neural network: vision graph U-Net (VGU-Net), which is the first model to construct multi-scale graph structures through the hierarchical down-sampling layers of the U-Net architecture. The graph structure is constructed by the self-attention mechanism. By replacing CNNs in the bottleneck layer and skip connection layers with the graph convolution networks (GCNs), the multi-scale graph structure visualization allows an interpretation of long-range interactions. We extend the VGU-Net backbone model for the widely considered compressed sensing MR image reconstruction task and propose a knowledge-driven deep unrolling scheme based on the half-quadratic splitting algorithm, which combines the interpretability of knowledge-driven model with the versatility of data-driven deep learning method to achieve remarkable reconstruction results. Moreover, we verify the segmentation ability of the VGU-Net backbone model on the multi-modality brain tumor segmentation dataset and white blood cell image segmentation dataset, and both achieve state-of-the-art performance.

  abstract = {Colorectal cancer constitutes 33\% of all cancer morbidity, so the research of the new methods for colorectal cancer diagnosis and chemotherapy monitoring is gaining its momentum. Diagnostic instruments are being sought, which enable the detection of single malignant cells based on the analysis of tissue material potentially reusable at further stages of diagnostic management. The most common approach to tissue specimen processing is paraffin-embedding. Yet, paraffin may cause background noise in spectroscopic measurements with the wavenumber ranging between 900cm-1 and 3500cm-1. However, the study by Depciuch et al. (2016) proved that appropriate specimen processing and paraffin-embedding technique as well as a strict measurement methodology may eliminate paraffin vibrations. As a result, spectroscopic measurements may become a reliable and precise method for the diagnosis and treatment monitoring in patients with colorectal cancer as long as the high standards of specimen processing are maintained. Chemotherapy is the main medical treatment in colorectal cancer. Unfortunately, the absence of tools which enable monitoring its efficacy leads to the partial response or non-response frequently seen in affected patients. Hence, diagnostic instruments are also being sought capable of monitoring treatment efficacy so as to enable early changes of chemotherapy regimen thus increasing the chance of cure. The paper aims at comparing the results of FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared) spectroscopy in several types of colon tissue: healthy colon, cancerous colon, post-chemotherapy colon and healthy surgical margin of colon cancer sample. The obtained FTIR spectra along with the Principal Component Analysis-Linear Discriminant Analysis (PCA-LDC) as well as bandwidth analysis of the primary amide region revealed some differences between the spectra of healthy tissues as compared to cancerous tissues (pre- or post-chemotherapy). Apart from confirming that FTIR spectroscopy is a good source of information on the composition of analysed samples, this fact supports its application as a tool to facilitate understanding the pathophysiology of various conditions and to monitor efficacy of chemotherapy in cancer patients.},

Prognostic assays which utilize bulk transcriptomics ignore the spatial context of the cellular material and are, therefore, of limited value in the development of mechanistic models. In this study, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) chemical images of BC tissue were used to train deep learning models to predict future disease recurrence. A number of deep learning models were employed, with champion models employing two-dimensional and two-dimensional-separable convolutional networks found to have predictive performance of a ROC AUC of approximately 0.64, which compares well to other clinically used prognostic assays in this space. All-digital chemical imaging may therefore provide a label-free platform for histopathological prognosis in breast cancer, opening new horizons for future deployment of these technologies.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

Unfortunately, safely resectable residual tumour is found in the majority of patients with glioma after surgery, causing early recurrence and decreased survival4--6. Here we present FastGlioma, a visual foundation model for fast ({$<$}10\,s) and accurate detection of glioma infiltration in fresh, unprocessed surgical tissue. FastGlioma was pretrained using large-scale self-supervision (around 4\,million images) on rapid, label-free optical microscopy, and fine-tuned to output a normalized score that indicates the degree of tumour infiltration within whole-slide optical images. In a prospective, multicentre, international testing cohort of patients with diffuse glioma (n\,=\,220), FastGlioma was able to detect and quantify the degree of tumour infiltration with an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 92.1\,{\textpm}\,0.9\%. FastGlioma outperformed image-guided and fluorescence-guided adjuncts for detecting tumour infiltration during surgery by a wide margin in a head-to-head, prospective study (n\,=\,129). The performance of FastGlioma remained high across diverse patient demographics, medical centres and diffuse glioma molecular subtypes as defined by the World Health Organization. FastGlioma shows zero-shot generalization to other adult and paediatric brain tumour diagnoses, demonstrating the potential for our foundation model to be used as a general-purpose adjunct for guiding brain tumour surgeries. These findings represent the transformative potential of medical foundation models to unlock the role of artificial intelligence in the care of patients with cancer.},

  abstract = {Colorectal cancer was one of the most frequent causes of death due to cancer in 2020. Current diagnostic methods, based on colonoscopy and histological analysis of biopsy specimens, are partly dependent on the operator's skills and expertise. In this study, we used Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and different machine learning algorithms to evaluate the performance of such method as a complementary tool to reliably diagnose colon cancer. We obtained FTIR spectra of FHC and CaCo-2 cell lines originating from healthy and cancerous colon tissue, respectively. The analysis, based on the intensity values of specific spectral structures, suggested differences mainly in the content of lipid and protein components, but it was not reliable enough to be proposed as diagnostic tool. Therefore, we built six machine learning algorithms able to classify the two different cell types: CN2 rule induction, logistic regression, classification tree, support vector machine, k nearest neighbours, and neural network. Such models achieved classification accuracy values ranging from 87\% to 100\%, sensitivity from 88.1\% to 100\%, and specificity from 82.9\% to 100\%. By comparing the experimental data, the neural network resulted to be the model with the best performance parameters, having excellent values of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity both in the low-wavenumber range (1000--1760 cm-1) and in the high-wavenumber range (2700--3700 cm-1). These results are encouraging for the application of the FTIR technique, assisted by machine learning algorithms, as a complementary diagnostic tool for cancer detection.},

  abstract = {Rapidly and accurately detecting and quantifying the concentrations of nitroaromatic explosives is critical for public health and security. Among existing approaches, explosives' detection with Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) has received considerable attention due to its high sensitivity. Typically, a preprocessed single spectrum that is the average of the entire or a selected subset of a SERS map is used to train various machine learning models for detection and quantification. Designing an appropriate averaging and preprocessing procedure for SERS maps across different concentrations is time-consuming and computationally costly, and the averaging of spectra may lead to the loss of crucial spectral information. We propose an attention-based vision transformer neural network for nitroaromatic explosives' detection and quantification that takes raw SERS maps as the input without any preprocessing. We produce two novel SERS datasets, 2,4-dinitrophenols (DNP) and picric acid (PA), and one benchmark SERS dataset, 4-nitrobenzenethiol (4-NBT), which have repeated measurements down to concentrations of 1 nM to illustrate the detection limit. We experimentally show that our approach outperforms or is on par with the existing methods in terms of detection and concentration prediction accuracy. With the produced attention maps, we can further identify the regions with a higher signal-to-noise ratio in the SERS maps. Based on our findings, the molecule of interest detection and concentration prediction using raw SERS maps is a promising alternative to existing approaches.},

  abstract = {Machine learning is shaping up our lives in many ways. In analytical sciences, machine learning provides an unprecedented opportunity to extract information from complex or big datasets in chromatography, mass spectrometry, NMR, and spectroscopy, among others. This is especially the case in Raman and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) techniques where vibrational spectra of complex chemical mixtures are acquired as large datasets for the analysis or imaging of chemical systems. The classical linear methods of processing the information no longer suffice and thus machine learning methods for extracting the chemical information from Raman and SERS experiments have been implemented recently. In this review, we will provide a brief overview of the most common machine learning techniques employed in Raman, a guideline for new users to implement machine learning in their data analysis process, and an overview of modern applications of machine learning in Raman and SERS.},

  abstract = {Cancer progression is linked to gene-environment interactions that alter cellular homeostasis. The use of biomarkers as early indicators of disease manifestation and progression can substantially improve diagnosis and treatment. Large omics datasets generated by high-throughput profiling technologies, such as microarrays, RNA sequencing, whole-genome shotgun sequencing, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry, have enabled data-driven biomarker discoveries. The identification of differentially expressed traits as molecular markers has traditionally relied on statistical techniques that are often limited to linear parametric modeling. The heterogeneity, epigenetic changes, and high degree of polymorphism observed in oncogenes demand biomarker-assisted personalized medication schemes. Deep learning (DL), a major subunit of machine learning (ML), has been increasingly utilized in recent years to investigate various diseases. The combination of ML/DL approaches for performance optimization across multi-omics datasets produces robust ensemble-learning prediction models, which are becoming useful in precision medicine. This review focuses on the recent development of ML/DL methods to provide integrative solutions in discovering cancer-related biomarkers, and their utilization in precision medicine.},

  abstract = {Fresh-frozen tissue is the ``gold standard'' biospecimen type for next-generation sequencing (NGS). However, collecting frozen tissue is usually not feasible because clinical workflows deliver formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks. Some clinicians and researchers are reticent to embrace the use of FFPE tissue for NGS because FFPE tissue can yield low quantities of degraded DNA, containing formalin-induced mutations. We describe the process by which formalin-induced deamination can lead to artifactual cytosine (C) to thymine (T) and guanine (G) to adenine (A) (C:G {$>$} T:A) mutation calls and perform a literature review of 17 publications that compare NGS data from patient-matched fresh-frozen and FFPE tissue blocks. We conclude that although it is indeed true that sequencing data from FFPE tissue can be poorer than those from frozen tissue, any differences occur at an inconsequential magnitude, and FFPE biospecimens can be used in genomic medicine with confidence:},

The laboratory experiments and computational modeling performed at NASA Ames Research Center generated a collection of PAH IR spectra that have been used to test and refine the PAH model. These data have been assembled into the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database (PAHdb). PAHdb's library of computed spectra, currently at version 3.20, contains data on more than 4000 species and the library of laboratory-measured spectra, currently at version 3.00, contains data on 84 species. The spectra can be perused and are available for download at ~               www.astrochemistry.org/pahdb/               . This paper introduces the library of laboratory-measured spectra. Although it has been part of PAHdb since its inception, the library of laboratory-measured spectra lacked a proper description in the literature. Here, the experimental methods used to obtain the data are described in detail, an overview of the contents of the experimental library is given, and specific tools developed to analyze and interpret astronomical spectra with the laboratory data are discussed. In addition, updates to the website, documentation and software tools since our last reporting are presented. Software tools to work with the spectroscopic libraries are being developed actively and are available at GitHub. Lastly, a comprehensive demonstration showing how the laboratory-measured data can be applied to explore absorption features in observations toward embedded sources is presented. This demonstration suggests that PAHs very likely contribute to interstellar absorption spectra associated with dense clouds and underscores the need for further IR spectroscopic studies of PAHs trapped in water ice.},

  abstract = {Simulating and modeling the long-term dynamics of multi-object physical systems is an essential and challenging task. Current studies model the physical systems utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with equivariant properties. Specifically, they model the dynamics as a sequence of discrete states with a fixed time interval and learn a direct mapping for all the two adjacent states. However, this direct mapping overlooks the continuous nature between the two states. Namely, we have verified that there are countless possible trajectories between two discrete dynamic states in current GNN-based direct mapping models. This issue greatly hinders the model generalization ability, leading to poor performance of the long-term simulation. In this paper, to better model the latent trajectory through discrete supervision signals, we propose a Physics-Inspired Neural Graph ODE (PINGO) algorithm. In PINGO, to ensure the uniqueness of the trajectory, we construct a Physics-Inspired Neural ODE framework to update the latent trajectory. Meanwhile, to effectively capture intricate interactions among objects, we use a GNNbased model to parameterize Neural ODE in a plug-and-play manner. Furthermore, we prove that the discrepancy between the learned trajectory of PIGNO and the true trajectory can be theoretically bounded. Extensive experiments verify our theoretical findings and demonstrate that our model yields an order-of-magnitude improvement over the state-ofthe-art baselines, especially on long-term predictions and roll-out errors.},

  abstract = {Background and objective Current studies based on digital biopsy images have achieved satisfactory results in detecting colon cancer despite their limited visual spectral range. Such methods may be less accurate when applied to samples taken from the tumor margin region or to samples containing multiple diagnoses. In contrast with the traditional computer vision approach, micro-FTIR hyperspectral images quantify the tissue-light interaction on a histochemical level and characterize different tissue pathologies, as they present a unique spectral signature. Therefore, this paper investigates the possibility of using hyperspectral images acquired over micro-FTIR absorbance spectroscopy to characterize healthy, inflammatory, and tumor colon tissues. Methods The proposed method consists of modeling hyperspectral data into a voxel format to detect the patterns of each voxel using fully connected deep neural network. A web-based computer-aided diagnosis tool for inference is also provided. Results Our experiments were performed using the K-fold cross-validation protocol in an intrapatient approach and achieved an overall accuracy of 99\% using a deep neural network and 96\% using a linear support vector machine. Through the experiments, we noticed the high performance of the method in characterizing such tissues using deep learning and hyperspectral images, indicating that the infrared spectrum contains relevant information and can be used to assist pathologists during the diagnostic process.},

Novel complementary approaches for molecular level diagnosis of the disease are need of the hour. Infrared (IR) imaging could be a promising candidate method as it probes the intrinsic chemical bonds present in a tissue, and provides a ``spectral fingerprint'' of the biochemical composition. To this end, IR spectral histopathology, which combines IR imaging and data processing techniques, was employed on seventy seven paraffinized colon tissue samples (48 tumoral and 29 non-tumoral) in the form of tissue arrays. To avoid chemical deparaffinization, a digital neutralization of the spectral interference of paraffin was implemented. Clustering analysis was used to partition the spectra and construct pseudo-colored images, for assigning spectral clusters to various tissue structures (normal epithelium, malignant epithelium, connective tissue               etc.               ). Based on the clustering results, linear discriminant analysis was then used to construct a stringent prediction model which was applied on samples without               a priori               histopathological information. The predicted spectral images not only revealed common features representative of the colonic tissue biochemical make-up, but also highlighted additional features like tumor budding and tumor-stroma association in a label-free manner. This novel approach of IR spectral imaging on paraffinized tissues showed 100\% sensitivity and allowed detection and differentiation of normal and malignant colonic features based purely on their intrinsic biochemical features. This non-destructive methodology combined with multivariate statistical image analysis appears as a promising tool for colon cancer diagnosis and opens up the way to the concept of numerical spectral histopathology.},

  abstract = {All machine learning algorithms use a loss, cost, utility or reward function to encode the learning objective and oversee the learning process. This function that supervises learning is a frequently unrecognized hyperparameter that determines how incorrect outputs are penalized and can be tuned to improve performance. This paper shows that training speed and final accuracy of neural networks can significantly depend on the loss function used to train neural networks. In particular derivative values can be significantly different with different loss functions leading to significantly different performance after gradient descent based Backpropagation (BP) training. This paper explores the effect on performance of using new loss functions that are also convex but penalize errors differently compared to the popular Cross-entropy loss. Two new classification loss functions that significantly improve performance on a wide variety of benchmark tasks are proposed. A new loss function call smooth absolute error that outperforms the Squared error, Huber and Log-Cosh losses on datasets with significantly many outliers is proposed. This smooth absolute error loss function is infinitely differentiable and more closely approximates the absolute error loss compared to the Huber and Log-Cosh losses used for robust regression.},

  abstract = {The recent discovery of special human neocortical pyramidal neurons that can individually learn the XOR function highlights the significant performance gap between biological and artificial neurons. The output of these pyramidal neurons first increases to a maximum with input and then decreases. Artificial neurons with similar characteristics can be designed with oscillating activation functions. Oscillating activation functions have multiple zeros allowing single neurons to have multiple hyper-planes in their decision boundary. This enables even single neurons to learn the XOR function. This paper proposes four new oscillating activation functions inspired by human pyramidal neurons that can also individually learn the XOR function. Oscillating activation functions are non-saturating for all inputs unlike popular activation functions, leading to improved gradient flow and faster convergence. Using oscillating activation functions instead of popular monotonic or non-monotonic single-zero activation functions enables neural networks to train faster and solve classification problems with fewer layers. An extensive comparison of 23 activation functions on CIFAR 10, CIFAR 100, and Imagentte benchmarks is presented and the oscillating activation functions proposed in this paper are shown to outperform all known popular activation functions.},

  abstract = {Convolutional neural networks have been successful in solving many socially important and economically significant problems. This ability to learn complex high-dimensional functions hierarchically can be attributed to the use of nonlinear activation functions. A key discovery that made training deep networks feasible was the adoption of the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function to alleviate the vanishing gradient problem caused by using saturating activation functions. Since then, many improved variants of the ReLU activation have been proposed. However, a majority of activation functions used today are non-oscillatory and monotonically increasing due to their biological plausibility. This paper demonstrates that oscillatory activation functions can improve gradient flow and reduce network size. Two theorems on limits of non-oscillatory activation functions are presented. A new oscillatory activation function called Growing Cosine Unit(GCU) defined as \$C(z) = z{\textbackslash}cos z\$ that outperforms Sigmoids, Swish, Mish and ReLU on a variety of architectures and benchmarks is presented. The GCU activation has multiple zeros enabling single GCU neurons to have multiple hyperplanes in the decision boundary. This allows single GCU neurons to learn the XOR function without feature engineering. Experimental results indicate that replacing the activation function in the convolution layers with the GCU activation function significantly improves performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Imagenette.},

DESIGN: Over a 4-month period in 1995, participants in the College of American Pathologists Q-Probes laboratory quality improvement program prospectively collected data on up to 30 FS procedures performed on elective inpatient surgical cases and completed questionnaires profiling their FS practice characteristics. SETTING: Surgical pathology laboratories serving private and public hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Seven hundred institutions located in North America (667), Australia (12), New Zealand (1), the United Kingdom (3), Hong Kong (1), Mexico (1), and Norway (1). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The 90\% FS block completion time defined as the time interval, in minutes, within which the fastest 90\% of all FS blocks were completed, measured from the time pathologists received FS specimens to the time they communicated FS results to the surgeon. RESULTS: Participants submitted data on 32868 FS blocks. Ninety percent of FS procedures were completed within 20 minutes. Frozen section turnaround times exceeding 20 minutes, termed outlier turnaround times, were more likely to occur when more than one pathologist participated in the FS diagnosis, pathology residents and medical students participated in the FS procedure, the pathologist had to retrieve and review previous case material during the FS procedure, the pathologist simultaneously received additional specimens from other FS cases, the pathologist was unable to reach a final FS diagnosis, and when technical problems occurred during the FS procedure. Seventy percent of all participating hospitals completed 90\% of their frozen sections within 20 minutes. The institutional 90\% completion times were shorter for hospitals containing 300 or fewer occupied beds than for those containing more than 300 occupied beds. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that 90\% of FS block turnaround times can be performed within 20 minutes, measured from the time that pathologists receive FS specimens to the time that pathologists return FS diagnoses to surgeons.},

We begin with discussion of two-photon theory and instrumentation particularly as applicable to cancer research, followed by an overview of some of the relevant cancer research literature in areas that include two-photon imaging of human tissue biopsies, human skin in vivo, and the rapidly developing technology of two-photon microendoscopy. We believe these and other evolving two-photon methodologies will continue to help translate cancer research from the bench to the bedside, and ultimately bring minimally invasive methods for cancer diagnosis and treatment to therapeutic reality.},

  abstract = {Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) describes a family of techniques first discovered and developed in the 1960s. Whereas the nascent history of the technique is parallel to that of laser light sources, recent advances have spurred a resurgence in its use and development that has spanned across scientific fields and spatial scales. SRS is a nonlinear technique that probes the same vibrational modes of molecules that are seen in spontaneous Raman scattering. While spontaneous Raman scattering is an incoherent technique, SRS is a coherent process, and this fact provides several advantages over conventional Raman techniques, among which are much stronger signals and the ability to time-resolve the vibrational motions. Technological improvements in pulse generation and detection strategies have allowed SRS to probe increasingly smaller volumes and shorter time scales. This has enabled SRS research to move from its original domain, of probing bulk media, to imaging biological tissues and single cells at the micro scale, and, ultimately, to characterizing samples with subdiffraction resolution at the nanoscale. In this Review, we give an overview of the history of the technique, outline its basic properties, and present historical and current uses at multiple length scales to underline the utility of SRS to the molecular sciences.},

  abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

Most critical is the efficient allocation of resource-heavy Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds to the patients who need life support. Central to solving this problem is knowing for how long the current set of ICU patients are likely to stay in the unit. In this work, we propose a new deep learning model based on the combination of temporal convolution and pointwise (1x1) convolution, to solve the length of stay prediction task on the eICU and MIMIC-IV critical care datasets. The model - which we refer to as Temporal Pointwise Convolution (TPC) - is specifically designed to mitigate common challenges with Electronic Health Records, such as skewness, irregular sampling and missing data. In doing so, we have achieved significant performance benefits of 18-68\% (metric and dataset dependent) over the commonly used Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network, and the multi-head self-attention network known as the Transformer. By adding mortality prediction as a side-task, we can improve performance further still, resulting in a mean absolute deviation of 1.55 days (eICU) and 2.28 days (MIMIC-IV) on predicting remaining length of stay.},

Our results show that as a forward model, our approach supports accurate predictions from real and simulated data, and surprisingly strong and efficient generalization, across eight distinct physical systems which we varied parametrically and structurally. We also found that our inference model can perform system identification. Our models are also differentiable, and support online planning via gradient-based trajectory optimization, as well as offline policy optimization. Our framework offers new opportunities for harnessing and exploiting rich knowledge about the world, and takes a key step toward building machines with more human-like representations of the world.},

Our model was robust to hyperparameter choices across various evaluation metrics: the main determinants of long-term performance were the number of message-passing steps, and mitigating the accumulation of error by corrupting the training data with noise.

Here, we specifically develop a stimulated Raman imaging based framework that demonstrates gastro-intestinal (GI) cancer detection of unprocessed human surgical specimens. The generated stimulated Raman histology (SRH) images combine chemical and collagen information to mimic conventional HES histopathology staining. We report excellent agreements between SRH and HES images acquire on the same patients for healthy, pre-cancerous and cancerous colon and pancreas tissue sections.

  abstract = {The absence of sufficient reliable methods for early detection of cancers requires a search for new and more effective techniques for screening and prevention. The discovery and introduction of appropriate techniques to test risk groups would increase the chances of successful treatment and subsequently reduce mortality. Accurate diagnostic tests and minimally invasive procedures are a main requirement for cost-effective screening tests. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is a non-invasive technology and can detect changes in a functional group in molecules from tissues or cells. The changes can be visualized by a spectrum of wavenumbers in the mid infrared range (4000 to 400 cm-1). FTIR has shown promises as a sensitive diagnostic tool to distinguish malignant from normal cells in cancers including tumors of colon, ovaries, breast, skin, cervix, lung and oesophagus. The biochemical changes are often observed between tumor and normal cells within a wavenumber range known as the ``fingerprint region'' (encompassing 1800 to 950 cm-1). The aim of this review is to summarize the application of FTIR for diagnosis of different types of cancer cells.},

  abstract = {Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has gained significant attention for its ability to detect environmental contaminants with high sensitivity and specificity. The cost-effectiveness and potential portability of the technique further enhance its appeal for widespread application. However, challenges such as the management of voluminous quantities of high-dimensional data, its capacity to detect low-concentration targets in the presence of environmental interferents, and the navigation of the complex relationships arising from overlapping spectral peaks have emerged. In response, there is a growing trend toward the use of machine learning (ML) approaches that encompass multivariate tools for effective SERS data analysis. This comprehensive review delves into the detailed steps needed to be considered when applying ML techniques for SERS analysis. Additionally, we explored a range of environmental applications where different ML tools were integrated with SERS for the detection of pathogens and (in)organic pollutants in environmental samples. We sought to comprehend the intricate considerations and benefits associated with ML in these contexts. Additionally, the review explores the future potential of synergizing SERS with ML for real-world applications.},

The performance of Deep Learning models fine-tuned on pretrained SSL representations is on par with models fine-tuned on the state-of-the-art supervised learning (SL) representations. Irrespective of the progress made in SSL, its generalizability has not been studied extensively. In this article, we perform a deeper analysis of the generalizability of pretrained SSL and SL representations by conducting a domain-based study for transfer learning classification tasks. The representations are learned from the ImageNet source data, which are then fine-tuned using two types of target datasets: similar to the source dataset, and significantly different from the source dataset. We study generalizability of the SSL and SL-based models via their prediction accuracy as well as prediction confidence. In addition to this, we analyze the attribution of the final convolutional layer of these models to understand how they reason about the semantic identity of the data. We show that the SSL representations are more generalizable as compared to the SL representations. We explain the generalizability of the SSL representations by investigating its invariance property, which is shown to be better than that observed in the SL representations.},

  abstract = {Background: Explainability is one of the most heavily debated topics when it comes to the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare. Even though AI-driven systems have been shown to outperform humans in certain analytical tasks, the lack of explainability continues to spark criticism. Yet, explainability is not a purely technological issue, instead it invokes a host of medical, legal, ethical, and societal questions that require thorough exploration. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the role of explainability in medical AI and makes an ethical evaluation of what explainability means for the adoption of AI-driven tools into clinical practice. Methods: Taking AI-based clinical decision support systems as a case in point, we adopted a multidisciplinary approach to analyze the relevance of explainability for medical AI from the technological, legal, medical, and patient perspectives. Drawing on the findings of this conceptual analysis, we then conducted an ethical assessment using the ``Principles of Biomedical Ethics'' by Beauchamp and Childress (autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice) as an analytical framework to determine the need for explainability in medical AI. Results: Each of the domains highlights a different set of core considerations and values that are relevant for understanding the role of explainability in clinical practice. From the technological point of view, explainability has to be considered both in terms how it can be achieved and what is beneficial from a development perspective. When looking at the legal perspective we identified informed consent, certification and approval as medical devices, and liability as core touchpoints for explainability. Both the medical and patient perspectives emphasize the importance of considering the interplay between human actors and medical AI. We conclude that omitting explainability in clinical decision support systems poses a threat to core ethical values in medicine and may have detrimental consequences for individual and public health. Conclusions: To ensure that medical AI lives up to its promises, there is a need to sensitize developers, healthcare professionals, and legislators to the challenges and limitations of opaque algorithms in medical AI and to foster multidisciplinary collaboration moving forward.},

  abstract = {Statins have displayed significant, although heterogeneous, anti-tumour activity in breast cancer disease progression and recurrence. They offer promise as a class of drugs, normally used for cardiovascular disease control, that could have a significant impact on the treatment of cancer. Understanding their mode of action and accurately assessing their efficacy on live cancer cells is an important and significant challenge. Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy is a powerful, label-free imaging technique that can rapidly characterise the biochemical responses of live cell populations following drug treatment. Here, we demonstrate multi-wavelength SRS imaging together with spectral phasor analysis to characterise a panel of breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-231 cells) treated with two clinically relevant statins, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin. Label-free SRS imaging within the high wavenumber region of the Raman spectrum (2800--3050 cm-1) revealed the lipid droplet distribution throughout populations of live breast cancer cells using biocompatible imaging conditions. A spectral phasor analysis of the hyperspectral dataset enables rapid differentiation of discrete cellular compartments based on their intrinsic SRS characteristics. Applying the spectral phasor method to studying statin treated cells identified a lipid accumulating phenotype in cell populations which displayed the lowest sensitivity to statin treatment, whilst a weaker lipid accumulating phenotype was associated with a potent reduction in cell viability. This study provides an insight into potential resistance mechanisms of specific cancer cells towards treatment with statins. Label-free SRS imaging provides a novel and innovative technique for phenotypic assessment of drug-induced effects across different cellular populations and enables effective analysis of drug--cell interactions at the subcellular scale.},

MLP-Mixer contains two types of layers: one with MLPs applied independently to image patches (i.e. "mixing" the per-location features), and one with MLPs applied across patches (i.e. "mixing" spatial information). When trained on large datasets, or with modern regularization schemes, MLP-Mixer attains competitive scores on image classification benchmarks, with pre-training and inference cost comparable to state-of-the-art models. We hope that these results spark further research beyond the realms of well established CNNs and Transformers.},

A proposed NN-based sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the most significant IR regions that distinguished benign from malignant samples. The result of the NN-based sensitivity analysis was compared to the obtained results from FTIR visual peak identification. In training each NN models, a 10-fold cross validation was performed and the performance metrics--area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), specificity rate (SR), negative predictive value (NPV), and recall rate (RR)--were averaged for comparison. The NN models were compared to six (6) machine learning models--logistic regression (LR), Na{\"i}ve Bayes (NB), decision trees (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA)--for benchmarking. The NN models were able to outperform the LR, NB, DT, RF, and LDA for all metrics; while only surpassing the SVM in accuracy, NPV and SR. The best performance metric among the NN models was 90.48\% {\textpm} 10.30\% for AUC, 96.06\% {\textpm} 7.07\% for ACC, 92.18 {\textpm} 11.88\% for PPV, 94.19 {\textpm} 10.57\% for NPV, 89.04\% {\textpm} 16.75\% for SR, and 94.34\% {\textpm} 10.54\% for RR. Results from the proposed sensitivity analysis were consistent with the visual peak identification. However, unlike the FTIR visual peak identification method, the NN-based method identified the IR region associated with C--OH C--OH group carbohydrates as significant. IR regions associated with amino acids and amide proteins were also determined as possible sources of variability. In conclusion, results show that ATR-FTIR via NN is a potential diagnostic tool. This study also suggests a possible more specific method in determining relevant regions within a sample's spectrum using NN.},

  abstract = {Bloodstream infection (BSI) is characterized by the presence of viable microorganisms in the bloodstream and may induce systemic immune responses. Early and appropriate antibiotic usage is crucial to effectively treating BSI. However, conventional culture-based microbiological diagnostics are time-consuming and cannot provide timely bacterial identification for subsequent antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) and clinical decision-making. To address this issue, modern microbiological diagnostics have been developed, such as surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), which is a sensitive, label-free, and quick bacterial detection method measuring specific bacterial metabolites. In this study, we aim to integrate a new deep learning (DL) method, Vision Transformer (ViT), with bacterial SERS spectral analysis to build the SERS-DL model for rapid identification of Gram type, species, and resistant strains. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we used 11,774 SERS spectra obtained directly from eight common bacterial species in clinical blood samples without artificial introduction as the training dataset for the SERS-DL model. Our results showed that ViT achieved excellent identification accuracy of 99.30\% for Gram type and 97.56\% for species. Moreover, we employed transfer learning by using the Gram-positive species identifier as a pre-trained model to perform the antibiotic-resistant strain task. The identification accuracy of methicillin-resistant and -susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA and MSSA) can reach 98.5\% with only 200-dataset requirement. In summary, our SERS-DL model has great potential to provide a quick clinical reference to determine the bacterial Gram type, species, and even resistant strains, which can guide early antibiotic usage in BSI.},

  abstract = {Raman spectroscopy, valued for its ability to provide detailed molecular fingerprints, plays a crucial role in industrial and academic research. However, optical artifacts, such as etaloning, often compromise the spectral quality, introducing unwanted intensity variations. Our research focuses on correcting these inaccuracies through inverse modeling, utilizing deep learning (DL). We used a traditional data-driven DL model to establish a performance baseline for etaloning correction. We then introduced a novel approach by integrating Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which incorporate underlying physical laws, to improve the accuracy of etaloning correction. Both methods were compared using design-out cross-validation to assess their generalization. We trained the models on synthetic data generated via forward modeling and fine-tuned them using real spectra. Our results demonstrate that PINNs outperform traditional DL methods, offering a more robust solution for etaloning correction in Raman spectra.},

The spectral region between 1200 and 500 cm-1 was yet disregarded for protein infrared spectroscopy, mainly due to the strong H2O absorption. Absorption spectra were obtained mainly for physiological relevant pH region. Intense bands for aromatic amino acids, histidine and such with OH group could clearly be identified throughout the given spectral region. For sulfur-containing amino acids cysteine and methionine some strong bands besides the weak carbon--sulfur stretching vibration was shown. Effects of aqueous solution environment, pH, protonation states were discussed, together with previously reported data from theoretical approaches. With this complete set of spectral information application to proteins in the whole mid infrared region could be described precise and the potential of the lower spectral region to study typical cofactor ligands like histidine, shown.},

Raman spectroscopy has shown promise for differentiating cancerous from non-cancerous tissue and is expected to be a new tool for oncological diagnosis. However, traditional Raman spectroscopy analysis requires tedious preprocessing, and the classification accuracy needs to be improved. In this work, a novel Raman spectral qualitative classification method based on convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed for the identification of three different colon tissue samples, including adenomatous polyp, adenocarcinoma and normal tissues. Experimental results show that this CNN model has superior feature extraction ability. For the spectral data of new individuals, the trained CNN model presents much better classification performance than traditional machine learning methods, such as the k-nearest neighbor, random forest, and support vector machine. Raman spectroscopy combined with CNN can be used as an effective auxiliary tool for the early diagnosis of colon cancer.},

  abstract = {Frog population has been experiencing rapid decreases worldwide, which is regarded as one of the most critical threats to global biodiversity. Therefore, large volumes of frog recordings have been collected for assessing this decline. Most previous studies focused on the syllable segmentation based frog call classification, which is sensitive to the background noise. Our recent study has used 1D-CNN and cross-entropy loss for frog call classification. However, the use of 1D-CNN is sensitive to the background noise and the imbalance of the number of different frog species is not considered. Therefore, this study aims to investigate loss functions and imbalance learning for bioacoustic signal classification in continuous recordings. Specifically, four types of loss functions are compared including cross-entropy loss, weighted cross-entropy loss, focal loss, and twin loss, which are combined with three CNN architectures: 1D-CNN, 2D-CNN, and 1D-2D-CNN. In addition, random oversampling is used for improving the classification performance of two imbalanced datasets. Experimental results show that (1) 1D-2D-CNN model can achieve the performance for classifying both Australia and Brazil frog calls. (2) Focal loss is the best among four loss functions for classifying low SNR recordings. (3) The highest macro F1-score for classifying both Australia and Brazil frog recordings are 89.26\%{\textpm}0.36\% and 93.47\%{\textpm}0.28\%.},

Current explainability approaches are typically local and treat GNNs as black-boxes. They do not look inside the model, inhibiting human trust in the model and explanations. Motivated by the ability of neurons to detect high-level semantic concepts in vision models, we perform a novel analysis on the behaviour of individual GNN neurons to answer questions about GNN interpretability. We propose a novel approach for producing global explanations for GNNs using neuron-level concepts to enable practitioners to have a high-level view of the model. Specifically, (i) to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work which shows that GNN neurons act as concept detectors and have strong alignment with concepts formulated as logical compositions of node degree and neighbourhood properties; (ii) we quantitatively assess the importance of detected concepts, and identify a trade-off between training duration and neuronlevel interpretability; (iii) we demonstrate that our global explainability approach has advantages over the current stateof-the-art -- we can disentangle the explanation into individual interpretable concepts backed by logical descriptions, which reduces potential for bias and improves user-friendliness.},

This study aims to address present challenges of SERS through a novel SERS bio-quantification framework, including spectral processing, analyte quantification, and model explainability. To this end,serotonin quantification in urine media was assessed as a model task with 682 SERS spectra measured in a micromolar range using cucurbit[8]uril chemical spacers. A denoising autoencoder was utilized for spectral enhancement, and convolutional neural networks (CNN) and vision transformers were utilized for biomarker quantification. Lastly, a novel context representative interpretable model explanations (CRIME) method was developed to suit the current needs of SERS mixture analysis explainability. Serotonin quantification was most efficient in denoised spectra analysed using a convolutional neural network with a three-parameter logistic output layer (mean absolute error = 0.15 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}M, mean percentage error = 4.67\%). Subsequently, the CRIME method revealed the CNN model to present six prediction contexts, of which three were associated with serotonin. The proposed framework could unlock a novel, untargeted hypothesis generating method of biomarker discovery considering the rapid and inexpensive nature of SERS measurements, and the potential to identify biomarkers from CRIME contexts.},

We find that existing training objectives for variational autoencoders can lead to inaccurate amortized inference distributions and, in some cases, improving the objective provably degrades the inference quality. In addition, it has been observed that variational autoencoders tend to ignore the latent variables when combined with a decoding distribution that is too flexible. We again identify the cause in existing training criteria and propose a new class of objectives (InfoVAE) that mitigate these problems. We show that our model can significantly improve the quality of the variational posterior and can make effective use of the latent features regardless of the flexibility of the decoding distribution. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative analyses, we demonstrate that our models outperform competing approaches on multiple performance metrics.},

The use of neural networks with CT imaging can potentially improve clinicians' efficiency in diagnosis. Previous studies in this field have primarily focused on classifying the disease on CT images, while few studies targeted the localisation of disease regions. Developing neural networks for automating the latter task is impeded by limited CT images with pixel-level annotations available to the research community., Methods: This paper proposes a weakly-supervised framework named ``Weak Variational Autoencoder for Localisation and Enhancement'' (WVALE) to address this challenge for COVID-19 CT images. This framework includes two components: anomaly localisation with a novel WVAE model and enhancement of supervised segmentation models with WVALE., Results: The WVAE model have been shown to produce high-quality post-hoc attention maps with fine borders around infection regions, while weak supervision segmentation shows results comparable to conventional supervised segmentation models. The WVALE framework can enhance the performance of a range of supervised segmentation models, including state-of-art models for the segmentation of COVID-19 lung infection., Conclusions: Our study provides a proof-of-concept for weakly supervised segmentation and an alternative approach to alleviate the lack of annotation, while its independence from classification \& segmentation frameworks makes it easily integrable with existing systems.},

We motivate the use of semi-supervised learning considering the fact that process quality variables are not collected at the same frequency as other process variables leading to many unlabelled records in operational datasets. These unlabelled records are not possible to use for training quality variable predictions based on supervised learning methods. Use of VAEs for unsupervised learning is well established and recently they were used for regression applications based on variational inference procedures. We extend this approach of supervised VAEs for regression (SVAER) to make it learn from unlabelled data leading to semi-supervised VAEs for regression (SSVAER), then we make further modifications to their architecture using additional regularization components to make SSVAER well suited for learning from both labelled and unlabelled process data. The probabilistic regressor resulting from the variational approach makes it possible to estimate the variance of the predictions simultaneously, which provides an uncertainty quantification along with the generated predictions. We provide an extensive comparative study of SSVAER with other publicly available semi-supervised and supervised learning methods on two benchmark problems using fixed-size datasets, where we vary the percentage of labelled data available for training. In these experiments, SSVAER achieves the lowest test errors in 11 of the 20 studied cases, compared to other methods where the second best gets 4 lowest test errors out of the 20.},
